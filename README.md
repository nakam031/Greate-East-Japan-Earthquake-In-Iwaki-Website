# Greate East Japan Earthquake In Iwaki Website
I created this website to introduce the damage and the recovery in Iwaki City, Fukushima, Japan, focusing on population change and physical recovery.
I migrated the information and maps on the poster which was designed using ArcMap, Adobe Illustrator and Indesign. Then, I used HTML, CSS and Bootstrap to create a resposive website.
